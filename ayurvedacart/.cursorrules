## Coding Standards & Best Practices

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration with no `any` types
- Define proper interfaces for all props and data structures
- Use generic types for reusable components and utilities
- Leverage discriminated unions for complex state management

### Component Patterns
```tsx
// Always use forwardRef for components that need refs
const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size }), className)}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    )
  }
)
Button.displayName = "Button"
```

### Styling Conventions
- Use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
- Leverage design system colors: `bg-primary`, `text-royal`, `shadow-healing`
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale

### State Management
- **Global State**: Use Zustand for cart, auth, and UI state
- **Server State**: Use React Query for API calls and caching
- **Form State**: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Local State**: Use React hooks (useState, useReducer) for component state

### API Integration
- All database queries through Supabase client
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use React Query for caching and background updates
- Leverage Supabase's real-time capabilities for live updates

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### Code Generation Preferences
- Write complete, production-ready components with proper TypeScript typing
- Always include accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, proper semantics)
- Use the royal design system colors and components consistently
- Implement proper error handling and loading states for all async operations

### Business Context Awareness
- Remember this is a premium wellness platform targeting global customers
- Focus on trust-building elements (certifications, authenticity, expert guidance)
- Prioritize user experience for both novice and experienced Ayurveda users
- Consider cultural sensitivity for global markets

### Performance Considerations
- Use Next.js Image component for all images with proper optimization
- Implement code splitting for heavy components and pages
- Leverage React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Optimize bundle size through tree shaking and dynamic imports

### Security & Privacy
- Implement proper input validation using Zod schemas
- Use Supabase RLS policies for database security
- Handle user data with GDPR and CCPA compliance in mind
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization
