## Educational Content

### Ayurveda Basics Section

#### "What is Ayurveda?"
"Ayurveda, often called the 'Science of Life,' is a 5,000-year-old system of natural healing that originated in India. Unlike modern medicine that focuses on treating symptoms, Ayurveda takes a holistic approach to health, addressing the root cause of illness while promoting overall wellness.

The foundation of Ayurveda lies in understanding that each person is unique, with their own constitution (Prakriti) and current state of health (Vikriti). This personalized approach ensures that treatments are tailored to individual needs rather than following a one-size-fits-all methodology."

#### "Understanding Doshas"
"According to Ayurveda, all life is governed by three fundamental energies called Doshas:

**Vata (Air + Space)**: Controls movement, circulation, and nervous system functions
**Pitta (Fire + Water)**: Governs digestion, metabolism, and transformation
**Kapha (Earth + Water)**: Responsible for structure, immunity, and lubrication

When these doshas are in balance, we experience good health. When imbalanced, disease manifests. Ayurvedic treatments work to restore this natural balance through diet, lifestyle, and herbal medicines."
